        <p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The program calculates the amount of color difference in a small patch 'Range' number of blocks from each square. The swap of two color blocks will occur if that reduces the amount of color difference the most, compared to other blocks in that patch. It takes a certain amount of time and processing power to do this calculation, and so adding a delay interval between calculations keeps processor utilization down, and makes things move in a steady way. The size of the grid can be changed, the color 'depth' per R-G-B component can be changed from 1 bit (2 intensities) to 8 bits (255 intensities) per component. Sorting is more obvious at low bit depth. And at a middle grid size the effect is quite abstract after a while.</span></p>
